# IMP is Turing-Complete

In this project we show the Turing-Completeness of the "simple imperative programming language" IMP,
as described in ["Concrete Semantics"](https://concrete-semantics.org/) by Tobias Nipkow and Gerwin Klein.
We do this by showing, that every Turing-Machine can be simulated by an IMP-program.
